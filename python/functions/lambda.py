# Anonymous functions
# also known as Lambdas
# can take any number of arguments
# can return just one value in form of expression

# syntax:
# function_name = lambda [arg1, arg2, ......, argn] : expression

# Function definition is here
sum = lambda arg1, arg2: arg1 + arg2

# Now you can call sum as a function
print ("Value of total : ", sum( 10, 20 ))
print ("Value of total : ", sum( 20, 20 ))
